### Download and install MATLAB

- You will need a fairly recent version of MATLAB (procedure tested on MATLAB 2012b and newer versions). For detailed installation instructions, click [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/compiler/install-the-matlab-runtime.html).

### Download the Face13 sample dataset

- The Face13 tutorial dataset can be downloaded from this [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xq85woDpAYXhCtzdgjkXpjjjggiWSKtc). Download the `sourcedata` folder from the drive. This folder contains the raw EEG data, standard montages that are used during initialization, and task information.

### Initalize Face13 data

- To run through this Lossless Parameters tutorial, the data needs to be initialized and in the BIDS standard. The steps to prepare data for optimizing pipeline parameters can be found in the [BIDS-EEG-EEGLAB tutorial](https://bucanl.github.io/SDC-BIDS-EEG-EEGLAB/). The BIDS-EEG-EEGLAB tutorial needs to be completed prior to this Parameters tutorial.
